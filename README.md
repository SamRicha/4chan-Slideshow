How to Use This Tool

Installation:

Copy all the code from the script.js file
While on a 4chan thread, open your browser's developer console:

Chrome/Edge: Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+J (Mac)
Firefox: Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+K (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+K (Mac)

Paste the code and press Enter

Features:

Extracts all images and videos from the current thread
Displays them in a fullscreen slideshow interface
Controls for navigation, play/pause, and exit

Note: This is a client-side script that only runs in your browser. It doesn't download files to your computer by default but simply displays the media that's already on the page.
